# Conway's Game of Life
Done using HTML, CSS and JS!

## Intro
This is a programming exercise meant to practise TDD programming. Also took the chance to try out flexbox, immutable js too. Jasmine is used for the tests.

## Work in Progress
Some logic bugs still remain _(it seems)_, writing more tests to pick out the edge cases to hunt the bugs down.
